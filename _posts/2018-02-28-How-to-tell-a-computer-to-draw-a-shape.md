**How to tell a computer to draw a shape**

**Today In IT we said goodbye to Mr T and started learning from a new teacher, Mr K. **

**Mr K started to explain that we can't just tell the computer to draw a shape. The computer needs a list or a step-by-step guide to draw a shape. So we slowly got the point and  ade the computer draw forward 120 pixels, then to turn ****_positively_**** 90 degrees and do the same thing 4 times. How ever this was a long way of writing the code out. So instead of writing it out multiple of times we put 'def draw_shape(sides, length)    for number in range(sides)  turtle.forward(length)    turtle.right(90)â€™ this not only allowed us to draw a square on the computer but any shape we wanted.**

**From there Mr K explained how to make some crazy patterns with this program.; For homework we were told that we had to make an equally crazy pattern on our pieces of code.**
