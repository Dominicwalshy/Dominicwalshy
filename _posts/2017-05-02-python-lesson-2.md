  <tr>
    <td>I learnt from the information bar next to where you have to input the code. I also learnt from our teacher who gave me directions as well as my partner. The best way of learning this time was y the hints given as it got harder as we progressed more. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As always the time limited my learning. As well as some stupid little mistakes by me because I was going to quickly, when I tried to complete the asks/ challenges. Me reading the question too quickly also slowed me down and therefore limited my learning</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will slow down so I can go faster, by not having to do the question or complete the task on more than one occasion. Also I will read the question more than once so /I can understand it better and complete the question as well as understanding it. And i will read the question(s) more slowly so I can attempt to answer it quicker and more efficiently.</td>
