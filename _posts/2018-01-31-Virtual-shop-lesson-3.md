**Virtual shop lesson 3**

**Today in IT I added one thing to my virtual shop. That was my tax return. So I started a new sheet and called it 'Tax yearly and monthly'. In this sheet I started with my gross salary yearly. This is salary before tax. So I put this in my sheet and took the number that I had in my monthly projections and multiplied this by 12 (12 months in a year). Then I set up my tax return. So I had a personal rate of £100,000, this number I don’t have to pay tax on. Then I set up a basic rate of £200,000 this amount i had to pay 15% tax on. Then I had a higher rate of £300,000 which I had to pay 30% tax on. Seeing as I still had some money left (I know, very hopeful) I set up an additional rate with a limit of £400,000, however I only used about £40,000 pounds in this rate. So I finished the year with   ****£616,526.74 net profit (profit after tax). So I ended up having to pay £24,239.26 tax. This came down to a £51,377.23 net profit monthly**
