(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes with some help from a new partner because my usual partner was ill</td>

    <td>The booklet was as helpful as ever, but the thing that helped me learn the most was a new partner who had already done all the work so he knew what he was doing. This was very helpful as he was quick so we could get more things done and I could learn about more things.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the time frame, as every time. I need to work on my speed typing so we can get more things done. Also I need to set up quicker to get more time on working and progressing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will have my old partner back so we will probably have not much progress, but to help my learning as well as being quicker I want to change more things like the page colour as well as the ink colour. This will make the coding I do look better.</td>
