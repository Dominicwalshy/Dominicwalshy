**I am an idiot**

**I am an idiot. When I recorded the blog post for the holiday and Python lesson 4 I put the wrong title. I then went on to my github account and deleted the post so I could repost it with a new title. When I went back into my google drive to redo the title, that Doc I had replaced with the blog post for next weeks work. Therefore I have deleted my holiday blog and lesson 4 accidentally. I start the holidays on about 21-28% and I am now on 38%.**

**Sorry **
