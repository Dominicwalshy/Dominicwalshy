**Virtual shop lesson 2**

**Today in IT we learnt how to make different spreadsheets in a single file. So along with our till sheet which has all our products and the prices, along with what are customers want to buy from us. However this sheet does not include how much of that item we have, how much of that product we have sold and how much we still have left to sell. So on our new spreadsheet we put on just those things. So we put on what items we have how much we have and how much we have left to sell and how much we have sold. However this "Virtual shop" became a little less virtual because on this sheet we also had to add on our business expenses. So, hypothetically, we had to add in what the rent would cost weekly and monthly, utilities, weekly and monthly as well as any people we employ. So there weekly and monthly expenses. Then the final thing that we did was add all of our stock worth as well as the profit then we took away all our business expenses to leave use with a final projected profit.     **
