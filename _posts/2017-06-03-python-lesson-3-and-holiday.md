    <td>We learnt that we had to be really specific when talking or, if you like, commanding a robot compared to when you ask a robot to do something. Sir gave us the example of making a cup of tea. We had to be really specific and then we had to think about colour. Sir really melted our brains when he said that red wasn't really red in his head but blue instead!</td>
