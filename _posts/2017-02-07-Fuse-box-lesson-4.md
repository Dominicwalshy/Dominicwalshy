(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>With my partner and via the handbook. The handbook is always very useful and working with a partner just quickens up the process and makes my learning happen quicker. The best strategy is if one of us reads whilst the other one types. This makes working and progressing quicker.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Time as always and also when we saved our program the second time it didn't save, but We realised that it overwrote the previous doc as we hadn’t started on a new doc. Other things that did limit my learning was the fact that it takes a while to save these things as well as the saving process being difficult! </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I won’t change much for next time as this week went very well. The only thing I would change if I could would be a longer lesson next week as I really enjoy this! The thing that would help would be practise saving to make it quicker, so we can learn more.</td>
