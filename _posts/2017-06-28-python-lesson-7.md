  <tr>
    <td>I learnt from the information bar next to where you have to input the code. I also learnt from our teacher who gave me directions as well as my partner. Another good way of learning is from the hints given on the sidebar. The best way of learning is definitely by the hint given just after the question. The questions are getting longer so it takes longer to do each bit of work. The quickest way to learn is by taking a lot of time for homework as well as working in lessons.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As always the time limited my learning. As well as some stupid little mistakes by me because I was going to quickly, when I tried to complete the asks/ challenges. Me reading the question too quickly also slowed me down and therefore limited my learning. The most frustrating thing that limited my learning was the fact that other people wanted my help! Also the fact that each question takes a while so you don't feel as if you are getting anywhere </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will slow down so I can go faster, by not having to do the question or complete the task on more than one occasion. Also I will read the question more than once so /I can understand it better and complete the question as well as understanding it. And I will read the question(s) more slowly so I can attempt to answer it quicker and more efficiently. Another way of improving is by asking the other people in my class as some of them are further than me and can help. Getting further in the program is taking alot of time so taking time for homework quickens up the project a lot.</td>
