**Spreadsheet shortcuts**

**Caesar Cipher**

**Today in IT we learnt how to give letters new values in a spreadsheet. So we started off by typing out the Alphabet. Then next to our Alphabets we typed whatever we wanted that letter to become. I chose to put 'A' as ‘D’ and ‘ B’ as ‘E’. Then a couple of cells across I typed the word that I wanted to change into a code, then underneath these cells I put the following code. ‘****=VLOOKUP(****E1****,****$A1:$B26****,****2****, ****false****)’**** So ‘E1’as where I put  The first letter of the word I want to code (If I do the first letter successfully then I can copy the code), Th ‘$A1:$B26’ is the bit where I typed my alphabet with the new letters that I want it to become. ‘2’ means that I want it to become the column next to this value as well as ‘False’. Then I drag it across and code the word!**

**To decode this new coded word I change the way the Alphabet and new values are so instead of 'A' then ‘D’ it goes to ‘D’ to ‘A’ and then change the new word and the original word so all it does is change the way my machine works.**

**Mr T also taught us some other things in today's lesson like how to edit the size of the cells and how to copy and paste this onto a google documents without the cells breaking up the letters.       **** **
