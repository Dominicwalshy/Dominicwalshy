**Today in IT we learnt some basics in google sheets or a spreadsheet. Our teacher, Mr T, taught us how to use the code in the program. For example we were taught how how to do basic adding by using the code in the program. We were also guided as to how to create a long list and then use a shortcut to find a certain item instantly instead of trying to find that item on a long list. Finally Mr T taught us how to add up a list then if we changed the quantity of the items we wanted then the price would change as well. I thoroughly enjoyed this lesson and I know that it will help me in the future!**
