    <td>I already new how to code a blogging site as of last year and the fuse box progress was really slow. We (my partner and I) had a handbook describing how to progress. We managed the first couple of steps easily but we had lots of trouble saving our work.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to learn how to save properly so I can move and progress faster. Also me and my partner need to have a better system where one of us reads the handbook, whilst the other inputs the code into the fuse box.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time we will ask others to help us when it comes to saving. We will try and develop a better way of completing the work, so we can do so more effectively and efficiently. </td>
