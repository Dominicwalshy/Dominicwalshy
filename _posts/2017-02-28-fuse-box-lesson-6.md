    <td>I learnt the same the same as every week. Using the handbook is always the best way and sometimes the only way to do so. I learnt also from other pairs around me and via my partner Ovo. Another way of learning was to look at the pictures these showed me where the wires had to go in the fuse box.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The time as always limited my learning, especially when you have to waste some of the lesson preparing, packing away and saving my work. It becomes very tedious but something that can't be avoided. Also Tyron trying to find out where to put the wires on the fuse box as there are many places put them.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I won’t change much. The only that helps is experience and every week we are packing away quicker and learning to save quicker so this makes life much easier. Also I will try to become a quicker typer so we don’t have to wait and spend more time typing but instead figuring out what we have to type. A final thing that could improve my learning would be to look more carefully at the pictures so we can see where they are putting the wires and be quicker to get more done.</td>
