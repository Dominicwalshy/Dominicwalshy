    <td>I learnt the same the same as every week. Using the handbook is always the best way and sometimes the only way to do so. I learnt also from other pairs around me and via my partner Ovo</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The time as always limited my learning, especially when you have to waste some of the lesson preparing, packing away and saving my work. It becomes very tedious but something that can't be avoided </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I won’t change much. The only that helps is experience and every week we are packing away quicker and learning to save quicker so this makes life much easier. Also I will try to become a quicker typer so we don’t have to wait and spend more time typing but instead figuring out what we have to type.</td>
