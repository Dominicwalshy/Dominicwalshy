    <td>I learnt from the information bar next to where you have to input the code. I also learnt from our teacher who gave me directions as well as my partner. Another good way of learning is from the hints given on the sidebar. The best way of learning is definitely by the hint gI've just after the question</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As always the time limited my learning. As well as some stupid little mistakes by me because I was going to quickly, when I tried to complete the asks/ challenges. Me reading the question too quickly also slowed me down and therefore limited my learning. The most frustrating thing that limited my learning was the fact that other people wanted my help!</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will slow down so I can go faster, by not having to do the question or complete the task on more than one occasion. Also I will read the question more than once so /I can understand it better and complete the question as well as understanding it. And I will read the question(s) more slowly so I can attempt to answer it quicker and more efficiently. Another way of improving is by asking the other people in my class as some of them are further than me and can help. </td>
