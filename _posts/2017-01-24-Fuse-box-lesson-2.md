    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had already input some code into our computers but we couldn't save it, so we took a pic of it on our ipads</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To progress more and learn how to save our work</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt through others and through the handbook supplied by my school. These were both very useful, especially my classmates as they told us how to save it as we were completely stuck</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that limited our learning this week was the time. This is because by the time we had progressed and learnt to save our work the lesson was almost over and sadly we didn't have time to start another piece of code. Time Flies when you have fun!</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I’m going to start a different project. So instead of just saying whatever it want it to, I’ll be able to make it do something different. This will be really help to do something else and not worry about having to save my work. Also it will teach me more skills to support my learning. As to doing something different I will just won’t have to worry about saving my work and that’ll be it.</td>
