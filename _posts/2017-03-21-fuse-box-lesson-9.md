    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>following on from last week using the handbook given to us in the lesson as well as the new electronics kit, we managed to start a light flash. We carried on with the same project As it is difficult work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have done more of the booklet and to progress more and try and get further using the electronic kit. To try and get multiply lights flashing And to finish this project.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> yes we used the electronic kit more and added in more wires and got the led light to flash, we did get multiply lights to flash, it was very complicated.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt the same the same as every week. Using the handbook is always the best way and sometimes the only way to do so. I learnt also from other pairs around me and via my partner Ovo. Another way of learning was to look at the pictures these showed me where the wires had to go in the fuse box. We also used the code on the textbook to set off the led lights. As the breadboard required was very confusing we struggled to see where the multi LEDs, cables and restrictors went. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The time as always limited my learning, especially when you have to waste some of the lesson preparing, packing away and saving my work. It becomes very tedious but something that can't be avoided. Also  trying to find out where to put the wires on the fuse box as there are many places put them. This was really difficult as the pictures weren’t very clear. But when we read the text we realized that it explained where to put them. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I won’t change much, except to read the text more. The only that helps is experience and every week we are packing away quicker and learning to save quicker so this makes life much easier. Also I will try to become a quicker typer so we don’t have to wait and spend more time typing but instead figuring out what we have to type. A final thing that could improve my learning would be to look more carefully at the pictures so we can see where they are putting the wires and be quicker to get more done. I would also like to progress and make progress with the light dependent restrictor ; I will do this by reading the text as well as looking at the pictures. Also to have a quicker start so we can get more done.</td>
