**Revamping my blog**

**Today in It was all about making our blogs work and update them. Seeing as we haven't been submitting blogs for 5 months Mr T believed we should fix our blogs if they weren’t working, update if they needed to be and make look as fresh as possible for the coming year. I believed that my blog was working fine until I submitted my first blog of the term and realized that my problem was that my repo and website name were different. Once I had fixed this problem I changed my avatar and background image to make them look better as well as making it easier for you to read. I also updated my description of the blog because I’m now in year 9 and that was about it. **
