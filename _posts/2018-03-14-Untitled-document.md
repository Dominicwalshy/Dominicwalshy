**Drawing My Initials**

**Today in IT Mr K showed us how to draw multiple letters together at one time. So as you can imagine trying to do this on a computer is much harder than doing it on a piece of paper. So the first challenge was getting our angles right so we could draw shapes. For example all of this has to be in code to create the letter 'A'.**

**turtle.left(75)**

**  turtle.forward(110)**

**  turtle.right(150)**

**  turtle.forward(110)**

**  turtle.backward(40)**

**  turtle.right(105)**

**  turtle.forward(43)**

**It was a headache trying to get these angles right not just for the letter 'A' but for the rest of my initials (D and W). the hardest out of these letters was definitely ‘D’. This was because I had to incorporate the curvature of the capital letter. Then once we had defined all of our letters the next challenge was to put them next to each other and make sure that they weren’t overlapping. The way i did this was by using ‘turtle.penup’ and ‘turtle.pendown’. These commands meant that I could move the turtle without leaving a trail. So when I finished a letter I could move onto the beginning point of the next letter easily and this meant that I could put spaces in between letters. And with a bit of extra time for homework it didn’t take me that long.**
