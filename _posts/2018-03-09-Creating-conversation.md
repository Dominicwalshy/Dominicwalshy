 **Making conversation /chat bots**

**Today in IT Mr K showed us what a chatbot was. I didn't realise how much coding was needed for a basic conversation. This is the code for a basic conversation.**

**print("Hello there!")name=input(“What is your name?”)print(“Nice to meet you,”, name +”!”)while True:print(“Are you well today,” ,name+”? Yes/No”)feel=input()if feel.lower() == “yes”:print("Glad to hear it!")breakelif feel.lower() == “no”:print("What a pity!")breakelse:print("Sorry, I don't understand that reply."**

**Then we had to make sure that our chat bots would pass the Turing test, or at least stand a chance of passing the Turing test. The Turing test is a test to see how human something is. Although some people have been known to fail the Turing test. Mr K explained showed us how to do this. It was quite hard at first but then we realised that lots of questions follow this pattern of code so we easily could code four questions.**
